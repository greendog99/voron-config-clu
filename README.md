Configuration and information about my Formbot Voron 2.4R2 300âœ•300 printer, named CLU.

## Modifications

The modifications I've made so far:

BTT PiTFT50 5" touchscreen running KlipperScreen. Mounted using [CannedBass's 45" mount](https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/CannedBass/PITFT50_45_degree_mount).

[+1mm Z drive belt tensioners by ZvB](https://www.printables.com/model/356388-voron-v24-z-belt-loop-tensioners-1mm) since my short Z motor belts were fairly loose after install.

Magnetic doors:
