# voron-config-clu
Configuration and information about my Formbot Voron 2.4R2 300âœ•300 printer, named CLU.

My configuration is broken up into many files:

* `printer.cfg` just includes all the other files from the `printer` subdirectory.
* `printer/printer.cfg` contains the main printer info.
* `printer/hardware/*` contains (mostly) physical printer configurations, such as stepper settings.
* `printer/macros/*` contains (mostly) gcode macros, like `PRINT_START`.
* It's (always) a work in progress.
