# voron-config-clu
Configuration and information about my Formbot Voron 2.4R2 300âœ•300 printer, named CLU.

My configuration is broken up into many files:

* `printer.cfg` just contains the main printer info and includes all the other files.
* `configs/*` contains (mostly) physical printer configurations, such as stepper settings.
* `macros/*` contains (mostly) gcode macros, like `PRINT_START`.
* It's a work in progress.

## Modifications

[+1mm Z drive belt tensioners by ZvB](https://www.printables.com/model/356388-voron-v24-z-belt-loop-tensioners-1mm) since my short Z motor belts were fairly loose after install.
